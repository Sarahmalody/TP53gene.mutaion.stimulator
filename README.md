# TP53gene.mutation.stimulator
This Perl script reads a TP53 DNA sequence from a file and checks for a specific mutation. If found, it replaces the amino acid at position 175 with histidine (H) and prints the mutated sequence. TP53 gene acts as a tumor suppressor and regulates cell division. Mutations in TP53 can lead to cancer.
